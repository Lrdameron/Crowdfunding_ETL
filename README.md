# ETL Pipeline Project

# Overview
This project involves building an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline using Python, Pandas, and other Python libraries to process and manipulate data. We will be working with data extracted from a source, transforming it using Python dictionary methods or regular expressions, and ultimately loading the transformed data into a PostgreSQL database. As part of the process, we will create CSV files, an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD), and a table schema.

#Project Description
In this project, we will work together to extract data from a source (such as a CSV or API), transform the data into a clean, usable format, and load it into a PostgreSQL database. We will:
Use Python and Pandas to process the data.
Apply Python dictionary methods or regular expressions for data transformation.
Save the processed data as CSV files.
Create an ERD and a table schema for the database.
Load the final CSV data into a PostgreSQL database.

# Technologies Used
Python: Core language for data manipulation.
Pandas: For data processing, transformation, and exporting to CSV.
PostgreSQL: For the final database to store the data.
CSV: For intermediate data storage before database insertion.
Regular Expressions (Regex): For string manipulation during transformation.
Jupyter Notebooks: For exploratory data analysis and prototyping.

# Steps
Step 1: Extract
      Extract raw data from the source (CSV, API, etc.).
      Load the data into a Pandas DataFrame for processing.

      
Step 2: Transform
      Clean and preprocess the data using Pandas operations.
      Apply Python dictionary methods or regular expressions to handle any complex data transformations (e.g., parsing dates, extracting specific information from strings, etc.).
      Perform any necessary data aggregations or calculations.
      
Step 3: Load
      Save the cleaned and transformed data into four separate CSV files, each representing a different dataset for the database.
      Create an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) to visualize the relationships between tables.
      Design a table schema for each CSV dataset.

# ERD and Table Schema
We will design an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) to visualize how the four datasets relate to each other. Based on the ERD, we will create a table schema for the PostgreSQL database.

# Database Setup
Once the CSV files are created, we will load the data into a PostgreSQL database.
Install PostgreSQL (if not already installed).
Create a new database for the project.
Create tables based on the table schema.
Load the data from the CSV files into the respective tables.

# Collaboration
Collaboration is key to the success of this project. Although tasks may be divided, both team members should:
Regularly check in to ensure progress is on track.
Offer assistance and guidance if needed.
Ensure data transformations and database schemas align.
Merge changes effectively and resolve any conflicts in the codebase.
